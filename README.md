# gojoeygo-acebook

Summary:
Welcome to the repository for our first engineering project at Makers Academy. In this project we aim to create a social networking web app 'acebook', written in Go.

The Team:
Our team 'Go Joey Go' is made up of four apprentices, 8 weeks into our 12 week bootcamp. For all of us, this will be our first time programming in Go.

Our Objectives:
Our primary objective is to TDD a functional web app in Go.
In addition to this we aim to document the process of learning a new language and develop our teamwork skills.

Technologies Used:
Primary programming language: Go
Front end languages: HTML, CSS
Text editors: Atom / VS Code
Web framework: Gin
Testing framework: Goâ€™s inbuilt testing functionality
Database: Posgres, pSQL, PQ, TablePlus, SQL
Version control: GitHub
Hosting platform: Heroku

Database Setup:
When working with this repo for the first time you must set up the database on your machine. We assume here that Postgres is installed.
To set up the database:
1. From the command line run psql.
2. Execute the commands stored in db/migrations
